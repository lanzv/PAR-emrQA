The Endocrine Team recommended decreasing his Synthroid dose to a level of 125 mcg daily. In addition, they recommended a bone densitometry study for evaluation of his bone mass following chronic maintenance on the steroid therapy and a history of hyperparathyroidism. The team thought that the patient's previous question of a mineral corticoid deficiency was likely due to his prior Cozaar therapy. They did not fell it was necessary at this point to preform a cortizone stimulation study or to further assess this possibility of a mineral corticoid deficiency.
